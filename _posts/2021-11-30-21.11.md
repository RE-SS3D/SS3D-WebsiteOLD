# November Recap

Another month of meticulously brainstorming over core-system design choices. These months often feel uneventful but are laying the groundwork for an entire user experience above them, so we are putting great time and attention to detail into them. Without spoiling too much, one of these systems should be featured in next month's blog if we have it ironed out and merged before then, so stay tuned.

## Details

**Notterox**
- Disabled users from using rich text in chat.
- Fixed custom font issue on the website.

**Ryan**
- Fixed multiple issues with the basic substance system and related machinery.

## Art

This month's blog cover art is brought to us by **SmokingMan**.
