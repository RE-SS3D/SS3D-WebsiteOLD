Slow, steady, and humble, we shall not stumble.

# February Recap

This month, we've continued chugging along making progress in core features, which is really exciting (more info below)! Seeing progress on core features is also a good opportunity for programmers or Unity enthusiasts to get their feet wet in RE:SS3D.

With progress on features, comes the process of resolving any issues that arise from it over time. Obviously, as many issues as possible will be flushed out initially but often times many bugs get overlooked. This comes the need for people to playtest the game, report bugs, and help fix bugs. If you want to help, there's currently several 'good first issues', tasks, bugs that need confirming and reporting on our [issues page]({{ site.github_url }}/SS3D/issues){:target="_blank"}.

## Rounds

**Em3rgency**, after being an absolute workhorse last month, has slowed down a bit this month but still decided to invest the time to implement basic rounds for the game. The round time starts right after the server is launched and you can see a timer in the top right corner. Currently, the rounds are limited to just 5 minutes before the server resets, due to there not being much to do right now anyway. If you can't wait the 5 minutes, there is also a manual server reset button, but is only visible to the hosting player.

## Lights/Shadows

New this month, **Lazerballs** has decided to address blob shadows and deferred lighting. After adding a hint of ambient occlusion on top and it really changes the atmosphere of the station. If you don't remember what it looked like before, just look at the video above.

## Interaction

If you remember last month, we had just introduced a new, basic interaction system but was still lacking our combat system. Well this month, **Nonanon** replaced it with another, new, less-basic interaction system. It should be more user-friendly when adding new interactions and also introduces the beginnings of the context menu.

Currently, the primary things that are implemented in the new interaction system are, picking up/dropping items, using storage containers, and constructing/deconstructing walls (crowbar) and tables (wrench). Unfortunately, the new system doesn't include our drawing system like the old one yet, nor does it reintroduce our basic combat system yet.

## Textures

**Sanuki** made a really cool rock floor this month a baked out a texture for us to use on our floor tiles, along with a [normal map]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/posts/20.02.01/SanukiLavalandFloorNormal.png){:target="_blank"} to give the flat surface 3D shading.

## Graphics

**Konstantin3001** continuing to provide 2D artwork. This month, some paper and book cover textures, and a bunch of various separated graphics of which only *a few* are displayed here. Several of the organs are used from the artist **Jakob Vogel** on [thenounproject.com](thenounproject.com){:target="_blank"}.

### Website 

Something that gets less attention, but deserves some every now and again is our website. Over the last couple of months, it has received formatting and documentation updates from both **Nonanon** and **CosmicCoincidence**. A few other updates this month, include a new header using the logo he made last month, a new [404 page]({{ site.baseurl }}/404/), [art page]({{ site.baseurl }}/art/), and updates to all of our primary pages. The most notable one being our home page, which now includes a big link for downloads, and provides an appropriate home for our (unofficial) trailer.

### Notes

As mentioned above, we have continued working hard on updating documentation, not just on our website, but also on our other sites, to help make the contribution process easier for everyone.

Well, that wraps up another month here at RE:SS3D, if you are curious about more content from us, or want to contribute to the project yourself, come visit our [discord]({{ site.discord_url }}){:target="_blank"}!
