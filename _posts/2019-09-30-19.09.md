Opening up has paid off, but the fruit still unripe.

# September Recap

For our efforts of making it easier for programmers to contribute, we've gained a few lovely new faces. Work continues. Sometimes it almost feels like a struggle on the artistic side looking for models that haven't been finished yet, but we still find ourselves wishing for more programmers.

## Chatlog

Excellent WIP from **Milly** this month; work has begun on a feature-rich chatlog. For all your communications-based multitasking woes, this chatlog is to support multiple tabs, windows, and filters for said windows and tabs. The video puts it better, however.

## Moving and Shooting

From **LightVelox** this month, early implementation of strafe-based movement and an aiming system. This will obviously end up being the base for the shooting system moving forward.

</video>

## Animations

Though not included in the above work, **Probably Not** has finished up some new directional movement animations and then some.

## Lavaland Aesthetics

Bridging the gap between everything else and Eye Candy, **Milly** has designed some lovely walls and ore walls for Lavaland, accompanied by matching ores and materials.The wall formations have different faces on each side, intended to be rotated randomly to easily mix up the environment to keep the lavaland tiles from looking too uniform.

## EYE CANDY

From **Goao**, an excellent compilation of items, alongside the diorama for this month's title art.
