Models, models, models models...

Our model game continues to improve.

# July Recap

## Modeler's Kit

Courtesy of the diligent **Eiko**, we now have a [3D modeler's kit](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fUn42ATEWXKvAGoWoCpN9EoURFW_7ppX?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}, making contributing models literally easier than ever! Contains a Blender 2.8 template file with materials and settings properly set up, so that people stop making models with backface culling disabled or sending stuff in with their normals facing the wrong way, *beep's original SS3D Style Guide, a brand new model formatting guide, a simple character turnaround for designing clothes and equipables, and the original Items-18-2-22b to serve as a collection of example models.

## SHAPE KEY MAGIC

Somewhere between the artistic and technical means of character representations is some beautiful use of a magical thing called shapekeys, which can change aspects of models as the shapekey variables are changed.
Here we have two examples of shapekey use: player eye states, and hair/headpiece compatibility.

{% responsive_image path: assets/img/posts/19.07.01/EikoExpressions.gif template: _includes/srcset-gif.html %}
</div>

Not groundbreaking, but a bit of insight on how character customization will work. Not pictured is how shapekeys are used for player body proportion sliders.

## EYE CANDY

**Eiko** continues to provide significant model contributions despite his other efforts on the project, and I am still certain I don't have all his contributions for the month.

From **deBARBA**, some birds and a blender, all animated, but not to imply those things should categorically mix.
