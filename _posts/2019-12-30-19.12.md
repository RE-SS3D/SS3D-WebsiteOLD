# December Recap

The sesason of giving has brought more new faces interested in contributing both through art and code! Now with so many willing faces but little direction, we have been discussing for some time various logistical changes to increase documentation, organization, and direction, as well as the speed and ease of over-all work-flow. But hitting some roadblocks trying to get these changes rolling, has unfortunately prevented us from being as timely with them as we would like. That being said, changes are taking place and direction beggining to take hold.

## Animations

**Probably Not**, who has been with us since beep's SS3D days, continues to patiently craft character animations for us without loosing stride or getting discouraged when we are slow. This month he has provided 4 more unique animations (opening cig pack and removing a cig, placing cig in mouth, opening lighter, using lighter). These animations will be associated with indiviual actions, but will be smoothed together when the player queues several actions quickly.

## Textures

Textures can be quite a lot of fun, and this martial arts scroll and several textures from **Sanuki** are no exception. Applying one of the custom [texture]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/posts/19.12.01/SanukiMartialArtsScrollTexture.png){:target="_blank"} files adds elegance and character to this simple scroll.

Animated textures can be just as fun. Here is a positronic brain from **CosmicCoincidence** with an electrifying video texture!

### Conclusion

This month has been a little slow as a result of both the logistical changes taking place as well as the holidays. The logistical changes put a hold on programming tasks, but now that the holidays are over, said changes should be wrapped up soon and programming resumed.

As always, come check out the [discord](https://discord.gg/3ny9tdH){:target="_blank"} for more wip content, and community discussions. Hope you all enjoyed your holidays and see you next month!
