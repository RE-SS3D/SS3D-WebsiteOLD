Despite being a slow month, continued evidence of our accomplishments continues to prove that we are not dead.

# April Recap

### SINGULARITY

Ol’ Singulo is here, complete with containment fields, courtesy of **PlayerOne**. Experience the horror of a containing an erratic and malevolent force of destruction to power basic utilities.

### ATMOS

After the mantle had been left sitting on the floor in a half-finished state months ago, **Dyhr** has picked up Atmos this month and is bringing it into a state of completion. While it hasn’t reached that completion yet, we’re still inclined to share our progress. Pictured here is nitrogen and oxygen.

### MODEL LIST

As one of the first steps to properly creating a good system for intaking model community submissions, we now have a big list of what models have and haven’t been explicitly accepted into the project. Most of the credit for this one goes to **White Eagle**, who made the majority of this twenty-something page document of items. Only a fraction of the list is seen [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/posts/19.04.1/ModelListWIP.png){:target="_blank"}.

# EYE CANDY

From **White Eagle**, we have cameras. These cameras were going to be for something special, but you will have to wait for the next devblog post for that detail.

From the combined efforts of **Konstantin** and **Sunberry** respectively, we have Ian flying into the sun.

Also from **Konstantin**, our first horizontal poster. You can use it as a desktop background, if you feel so inclined.

### MUTINY

We have also very recently changed our leadership in the project, complete with a total restructuring of internal management into a system of teams, with our most competent members at the lead of them.

This is our monthly devblog, here to assure you that we have yet to die.
