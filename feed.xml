&lt;h1 id=&quot;october-recap&quot;&gt;October Recap&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very few merged changes this month, but none were lacking in importance as they are all related to networking or core system performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;details&quot;&gt;Details&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alainx277&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;GREATLY improved the performance of the examine system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ryan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Updated the Mirror version for the project, to v49.0.1.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed a bug where clients weren’t reinitializing the map after it loaded.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed an issue preventing child objects from being found during reinitialization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;art&quot;&gt;Art&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As per usual, this month’s blog cover was contributed by &lt;strong&gt;ProbablyNot&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/img/art/ProbablyNot/ProbablyNot_Heck.png&quot; class=&quot;image-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;    /assets/resized/ProbablyNot_Heck-580x326.png 580w,    /assets/resized/ProbablyNot_Heck-290x163.png 290w,    /assets/resized/ProbablyNot_Heck-170x96.png 170w,    /assets/resized/ProbablyNot_Heck-145x82.png 145w, /assets/img/art/ProbablyNot/ProbablyNot_Heck.png 3840w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 578px, 580px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And another was bestowed on us by &lt;strong&gt;John&lt;/strong&gt; this month too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/img/art/Goao/JohnDrifting.png&quot; class=&quot;image-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;    /assets/resized/JohnDrifting-580x326.png 580w,    /assets/resized/JohnDrifting-290x163.png 290w,    /assets/resized/JohnDrifting-170x96.png 170w,    /assets/resized/JohnDrifting-145x82.png 145w, /assets/img/art/Goao/JohnDrifting.png 1920w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 578px, 580px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another month with little progress to show but don’t let that discourage your hopes for this game, if you want to see more intermittent progress, feel free to join us in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://discord.gg/3ny9tdH&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt; server.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>CosmicCoincidence</name></author><summary type="html">Small changes with a big impact.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://ss3d.space/assets/img/art/ProbablyNot/ProbablyNot_Heck.png" /></entry><entry><title type="html">21.09: September 2021 Devblog</title><link href="https://ss3d.space/2021/10/06/21.09.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="21.09: September 2021 Devblog" /><published>2021-10-06T11:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-10-06T11:30:00+00:00</updated><id>https://ss3d.space/2021/10/06/21.09</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ss3d.space/2021/10/06/21.09.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The world is indeed comic, but the joke is on mankind.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;september-recap&quot;&gt;September Recap&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re still making a lot of good progress on our core systems, laying the foundations for the rest of the game above them. This month it was the container system that received an overhaul, following a load of bug fixes. We’re still inching closer every month to completing our first milestone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;container-system&quot;&gt;Container System&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stilnat&lt;/strong&gt; reworked our ‘system of containers’ into a more proper ‘container system’ by combining our several container-related scripts into a singular script. Now all container parameters like its type, its size, if it displays its contents, etc. are all under a single script. This refinement should make it more intuitive and easy when adding new container objects to the game and helped clean things up from the code perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The improved system now also allows for adding multiple containers to a single game object which can be interacted with individually. It also fixes a few bugs relating to containers. A couple of the bugs were specific to container’s UIs staying open for various reasons, another was that items could still be removed when containers were closed. Mobile container’s animations are also now tied to their UIs so they can be opened and viewed with the same interaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;details&quot;&gt;Details&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nsarrazin&lt;/strong&gt; (new this month)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed a bug where the chat sent its message when out of focus.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improved the intent button appearance, making the background and alignment consistent with the others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ryan&lt;/strong&gt;, The Bug Exterminator&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Updated the Unity version for the project. We are now using 2019.4.30f1 (2019 LTS).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Resolved an inconsistency in the range between different interactions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed a bug where multiple players would cause extra unnecessary audio listeners.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed a bug where the hover examine system caused an unintentional extra text to overlay the examine text.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed the other half of the bug he half-fixed last month regarding items disappearing instead of dropping when the player falls down.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Resolved an issue with containers syncing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2d&quot;&gt;2D&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cornelius&lt;/strong&gt; created this neat runic font that can be used for unintelligible cult speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/img/posts/21.09.01/CultFont.png&quot; class=&quot;image-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;    /assets/resized/CultFont-580x387.png 580w,    /assets/resized/CultFont-290x193.png 290w,    /assets/resized/CultFont-170x113.png 170w,    /assets/resized/CultFont-145x97.png 145w, /assets/img/posts/21.09.01/CultFont.png 900w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 578px, 580px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;art&quot;&gt;Art&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SmokingMan&lt;/strong&gt; contributed for the first time this month with this relatable artwork!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/img/art/SmokingMan/SmokingMan_Closet.png&quot; class=&quot;image-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;    /assets/resized/SmokingMan_Closet-580x326.png 580w,    /assets/resized/SmokingMan_Closet-290x163.png 290w,    /assets/resized/SmokingMan_Closet-170x96.png 170w,    /assets/resized/SmokingMan_Closet-145x82.png 145w, /assets/img/art/SmokingMan/SmokingMan_Closet.png 1920w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 578px, 580px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;august-recap&quot;&gt;August Recap&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another steady month here at RE:SS3D, as we continue to get a trickling of new contributors each month, both in the art and programming departments! Though, it’s actually a special month because as of just a couple of days ago we (RE:SS3D) had our 3rd anniversary, which many of us have difficulty believing it has already been that long. These last few years have produced huge amounts of discussion which sparked hundreds of ideas that have helped pave the way toward actually making 3D SS13 feasible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, a big roadblock was lifted this month with the merging of our latest (and hopefully last ever) tilemap rework. From here we can finally begin a deeper discussion into systems we otherwise were holding off due to them relying on such a rework. We’re not out of the woods yet though, because after you clear one fallen tree there will surely be another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;contributors-kit-updates&quot;&gt;Contributors’ Kit Updates&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This month &lt;strong&gt;ProbablyNot&lt;/strong&gt; updated the animator’s kit by adding some additions &amp;amp; optimizations to the character rig as well as updated some meshes. Note that the animator’s kit is currently Maya only and not for Blender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The updated animator’s kit (v1.5) can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1V8QAE9651nYJffCSz9zjjygextDHN-GQ?usp=sharing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (download the whole folder).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve also been long overdue for a new modeler’s kit update, so it feels good to finally get this update out. If you are an active modeler, please update your kit as the changes are fairly significant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spongie&lt;/strong&gt; adjusted the burgundy reds on the Palette05, the colors are more similar now and the shades have a smoother gradient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eiko&lt;/strong&gt; added a rigging template (.blend) and an accompanying guide pdf. The rigging template file contains template models for most general clothing objects both in item form and worn on the body form; while the guide goes into the details on how to make the clothing and hair work correctly with the player model and game design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;strong&gt;CosmicCoincidence&lt;/strong&gt; added an file full of &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/img/posts/21.08.01/ExampleModels.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;example models&lt;/a&gt; (.blend) which can be used as a quick reference for scale, styling, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The updated modeler’s kit (v2.0) can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11SMsOzh78-vNTq3Az5c-mUFpFw-5EOb8?usp=sharing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (download the whole folder).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chat-system&quot;&gt;Chat System&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Singulo&lt;/strong&gt; significantly repaired and upgraded the chat system this month. He repaired the send controls and prevented the player from inputting rich text. He prevented chat windows from having no tabs and made the selected tab easier to identify. He got the channel selector to properly update. The close tab button works now and you can also re-order your tabs like a web browser. He did some repositioning and scaling of the chat UI. And he added the key ‘C’ to toggle the chat window open/close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calmilamsy&lt;/strong&gt; (new this month) added a similar control, press ‘T’ to focus the chat window to quickly start typing (it will also toggle the window open if closed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tilemap-rework&quot;&gt;Tilemap Rework&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is like our 3rd or 4th tilemap rework now, I don’t even know anymore. But &lt;strong&gt;BroodjeKipcorn&lt;/strong&gt; has once again done God’s work by upgrading our previous tilemap system with many new features. Some of these features were necessary for us to move forward on dependent systems like electricity, gravity, shuttles, and more. The reworking process also resolved numerous tilemap-related bugs and even improves on our previous tilemap editor as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The design for the reworked system was finalized by &lt;strong&gt;Broodje&lt;/strong&gt;, but many people had a part in helping with the brainstorming. One very notable individual who did a lot of work on the design initially is &lt;strong&gt;Onebi&lt;/strong&gt; who spent a good amount of time conceptualizing and documenting a new design prior to it being scrutinized by the community and being finished up by &lt;strong&gt;Broodje&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The upgraded system is still tile-based but leverages collections more to process through objects on the same layer a bit faster. It also now divides the tilemap into &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/img/posts/21.08.01/TilemapChunks.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;16 x 16 chunks&lt;/a&gt; which should allow for a more optimized system as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tilemap is now fully serialized and can be both saved and loaded at will. This should not only make resolving Github merging conflicts on the map easier but will also allow for a wide assortment of possibilities like saving a broken down or chaotic station to load at the beginning of a new round for a rescue or clean-up mission. This could also be used to save multiple layouts of certain rooms, so areas of a station could be randomized between rounds while other areas remain consistent. (Currently saving and loading is only possible in the tilemap editor in Unity but we plan for the function to be possible in-game as well.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multi-tiled objects (ex. the cryotube is 2x2 tiles) are now supported by the tilemap and can no longer be placed in ways that clip into other nearby tile-based objects (structures/furniture). This on the surface seems fairly trivial but proved rather difficult with the possibility that a multi-tiled object could overlap multiple tilemap chunks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another huge fix is that the tile object networking is no longer broken which fixed a few bugs but most notably where certain tile object states were not synced across server and client (like the jukebox being turned on for 1 player but not the other).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably my favorite part of the tilemap rework is the addition of multiple tilemap support, this means that we are no longer are limited to just 1 tilemap per map. This allows for things like shuttles/ships/pods to have their own tilemap and move and rotate irrespectively of one another. Although we do not have tilemap movement or rotation implemented yet, this will allow for truly pilotable ships (which we have many ideas for). The support for multiple tilemaps within a singular map may allow for us to even break apart ships/stations into multiple separate objects which drift apart instead of staying locked in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tilemap editor also received many upgrades to complement the system upgrades it also still includes all the great features from before. Since we can now have multiple tilemaps within a map file, you can easily switch your active tilemap with a click of a button to switch between them and a setting to mark one of these tilemaps as the primary tilemap. The editor tells you how many map chunks your tilemap is made up of and can outline them on the map with a toggle setting. Another toggle setting that was added is the overwrite setting which means you can easily replace an object with another object of the same layer type in one action instead of having to delete the first object and then place the new object. Finally, it is also now possible to &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/img/posts/21.08.01/TilemapLayers.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;visibly toggle tilemap layers&lt;/a&gt; to make it easier to see and work on other layers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the rework resulted in us having to toss out our old maps, &lt;strong&gt;Broodje&lt;/strong&gt; kindly built us a new “ministation” map which has a secondary “shuttle” tilemap included. There’s a BUNCH more little improvements and fixes that were included in this rework that I simply didn’t cover here too. I wanted to include a clip of the tilemap system to visually show it off a bit more, but there isn’t much to show at this time besides looking at a map. Once we get tilemap movement implemented that will change and I promise to get you guys that clip then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;details&quot;&gt;Details&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Singulo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Added a game controls page to the settings menu and listed all current controls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ryan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Added a &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/img/posts/21.08.01/HoverExamine.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;new hover-based examination feature&lt;/a&gt; which only displays object names as opposed to the detailed examine which can have a description, a UI, or other additions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Added an outline to examination texts to make them contrast the background and make them easier to read.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed a bug that sometimes prevented players from joining mid-round.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Half-fixed a bug that when the player fell any items they held would disappear, now only 1 item disappears, and the other drops to the ground… Progress!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Liam&lt;/strong&gt; (new this month)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Updated the humanoid animator to prevent the character from continuously running into stuff, the character will now stop moving when up against an obstacle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;models&quot;&gt;Models&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cornelius&lt;/strong&gt; stopped by momentarily this month to drop off some plants, you may recognize some of them from your favorite SS13 servers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I (&lt;strong&gt;CosmicCoincidence&lt;/strong&gt;) decided to model and submit these basic wooden fences. Why? &lt;em&gt;shrug&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These eventful months are always a blast, and with the tilemap roadblock now lifted these active months &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; start becoming more common for us. We also want to thank all of our supporters, contributors, and idea guys over the last 3 years. As a contributor and maintainer for the last 2 years, it’s been a hell of a blast and I know the other developers will say the same thing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;july-recap&quot;&gt;July Recap&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although SS3D is still in a very early state, every month brings us a few steps closer to a playable game, this month is no exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;gen&lt;/strong&gt; (new this month) made a classic diner booth seat, and &lt;strong&gt;CosmicCoincidence&lt;/strong&gt; assisted by making it into modular pieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This month’s great cover art comes from the talented &lt;strong&gt;ProbablyNot&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– Immortal Technique&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;june-recap&quot;&gt;June Recap&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June brought us several small fixes and quality of life features both within the game and outside of it. We added a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/RE-SS3D/SS3D/discussions&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;discussions tab on github&lt;/a&gt; which we will begin hosting various community discussions. If you feel inclined you can even start your own discussion, like providing feedback, making a suggestion, or asking the community a question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;examine-system-rework&quot;&gt;Examine System Rework&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ryan&lt;/strong&gt; reworked the entire examine system, and also added several improvements. One of the new key features is the creation of a modular UI system, making it easier to create custom examine interfaces (see the poster and ID card in the video below). These interfaces can be linked with custom data, like adding a character’s name, age, or even appearance to an ID card interface (which was made by &lt;strong&gt;Eiko&lt;/strong&gt; but currently uses 3 random identities as temporary placeholder data until we get custom characters in the game).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other new key feature is the addition of modular requirements. New requirements can be customized and added easily. An example of a requirement is needing to hold a certain item to display specific examination information. Another example is needing to stand a certain distance from the object (notice in the video below when examining the poster and ID card, the text is only displayed if the player is more than 1.5 tiles away, but within this distance, an image is also shown).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system also now allows for examining items that are in containers that display their content (ex. items on the custodial cart or an item in another player’s hand), it also now allows for examining items in a UI (like an item in your pocket or another type of UI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;video controls=&quot;&quot; muted=&quot;&quot; poster=&quot;/assets/img/posts/21.06.01/ExamineUI.png&quot; width=&quot;580px&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;
  &lt;source src=&quot;/assets/img/posts/21.06.01/ExamineUI.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the curious, more information on the new examine system can be found in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xTyRXzi1g7H3SOkw1wkrFFbMcDUA0VEE/view?usp=sharing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Examine Design Document&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;strong&gt;Ryan&lt;/strong&gt; included.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;container-system-expansion&quot;&gt;Container System Expansion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now have 2 new types of technical containers, thanks to &lt;strong&gt;LightVelox&lt;/strong&gt;, ‘hidden’ containers and ‘pile’ containers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hidden containers are containers the player does not directly interact with but may do so indirectly (like the battery inside of some machines or energy weapons, which can be charged indirectly but cannot be removed from the object).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pile containers are containers that you can insert/remove items but, unlike regular containers, these have no container UI (like the power cell charger which only accepts 1 battery at a time and you insert or remove the battery by interacting the with charger itself instead of a UI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;details&quot;&gt;Details&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ryan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed the broken server ‘disconnect’ button.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed an issue preventing clients from loading a map after disconnecting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;stilnat&lt;/strong&gt; (new this month)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Added swapping hands via clicking on the UI.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Added the names of containers to their UI.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Made the clothing UI collapsable via toggle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;frimannloes&lt;/strong&gt; (new this month)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set the desk lamp light to toggle via interaction.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set flashlight &amp;amp; desk lamp materials to toggle with light toggle (help from &lt;strong&gt;jake34b&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;mjboth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed a bug allowing containers to store themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seteron&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed an issue preventing airlocks from being rotated on the map.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CosmicCoincidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finished renaming &amp;amp; organizing project assets from last month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;models&quot;&gt;Models&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chinwizard&lt;/strong&gt; (new this month) made this great bulldog semi-auto shotgun with various magazine types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/img/posts/21.06.01/ChinwizardBulldog.png&quot; class=&quot;image-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;    /assets/resized/ChinwizardBulldog-580x435.png 580w,    /assets/resized/ChinwizardBulldog-290x218.png 290w,    /assets/resized/ChinwizardBulldog-170x128.png 170w,    /assets/resized/ChinwizardBulldog-145x109.png 145w, /assets/img/posts/21.06.01/ChinwizardBulldog.png 800w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 578px, 580px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Baga&lt;/strong&gt; is back with an awesome paramedic ambulance and 2 trailers. One trailer is a patient transport bed, the other trailer is a fold-out mobile operation table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-2&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nicola&lt;/strong&gt; returned with some more long hairdos (note that they will have flexibility and wont stay straight as seen in the images).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-2&quot;&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;textures&quot;&gt;Textures&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Konstantin3001&lt;/strong&gt; never seems to go more than a couple of months without giving us something. This month he is back with these cute little particle textures.&lt;/p&gt;

Because a dance with the Devil might last you forever…”</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://ss3d.space/assets/img/art/Bug/BugCult.png" /></entry><entry><title type="html">21.05: May 2021 Devblog</title><link href="https://ss3d.space/2021/06/04/21.05.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="21.05: May 2021 Devblog" /><published>2021-06-04T11:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-06-04T11:30:00+00:00</updated><id>https://ss3d.space/2021/06/04/21.05</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ss3d.space/2021/06/04/21.05.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What could we accomplish if we knew we could not fail?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– Eleanor Roosevelt&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;may-recap&quot;&gt;May Recap&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we are still reworking the tilemap design we made some progress this month with fixing and cleaning the project up. We also made a Twitter account this month so if you are active there, go give &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SpaceStation3D&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;us a follow&lt;/a&gt;! Related to that, &lt;strong&gt;viniciusueharaweb&lt;/strong&gt; added some nice vector graphics for our social media links in the footer of this website (see bottom of page).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lung-cancer&quot;&gt;Lung Cancer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implemented by &lt;strong&gt;peeB&lt;/strong&gt;, cigarettes and joints are now consumed when lit, currently lasting just 10 seconds. Even includes an extinguish interaction. Fine-tuning will come later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;video controls=&quot;&quot; muted=&quot;&quot; poster=&quot;/assets/img/posts/21.05.01/Smokin.png&quot; width=&quot;580px&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;
  &lt;source src=&quot;/assets/img/posts/21.05.01/Smokin.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;details&quot;&gt;Details&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LightVelox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Added a secondary hold point for certain objects, fixing a problem where certain items clipped into the character when held.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Added starting filters for specific container types to prevent certain items in them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed a bug in the container UI that when you drag the UI the slots of the container move but not the items which caused a glitch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CosmicCoincidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Renamed many files for consistency and removed some outdated ones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eiko&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Added a new Unity gizmo to help visualize the placement and orientation of our hold points on objects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;mjboth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Re-encoded our Surgery Console animated texture, fixing the stutter it had.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seteron&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reduced the medkit and toolbox animations so they open less and prevent clipping.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Updated UI slot image, preventing the issue of not being able to see which hand is selected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BroodjeKipcorn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Updated the delete function in the tilemap editor so it only deletes the active layer instead of the whole tile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ryan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Updated a few game controls.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Renamed a couple of interaction methods to reduce confusion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;models&quot;&gt;Models&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turkey&lt;/strong&gt; who is a long-time community member but doesn’t often contribute, surprised us with a cute maintenance drone this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/img/posts/21.05.01/TurkeyMaintDrone.png&quot; class=&quot;image-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;    /assets/resized/TurkeyMaintDrone-580x435.png 580w,    /assets/resized/TurkeyMaintDrone-290x218.png 290w,    /assets/resized/TurkeyMaintDrone-170x128.png 170w,    /assets/resized/TurkeyMaintDrone-145x109.png 145w, /assets/img/posts/21.05.01/TurkeyMaintDrone.png 800w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 578px, 580px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The great &lt;strong&gt;Cornelius&lt;/strong&gt; is back this month with some nostalgic squirt guns and intriguing xeno egg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-2&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eiko&lt;/strong&gt; is back this month as well with a goofy cardboard cutout and a new set of airlocks, including secure airlocks and a fire-lock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/img/posts/21.05.01/CardboardCutout.png&quot; class=&quot;image-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;    /assets/resized/CardboardCutout-580x435.png 580w,    /assets/resized/CardboardCutout-290x218.png 290w,    /assets/resized/CardboardCutout-170x128.png 170w,    /assets/resized/CardboardCutout-145x109.png 145w, /assets/img/posts/21.05.01/CardboardCutout.png 800w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 578px, 580px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;textures&quot;&gt;Textures&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also from &lt;strong&gt;Eiko&lt;/strong&gt; this month, are these hilarious posters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-2&quot;&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/img/posts/21.05.01/ERPNO.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;    /assets/resized/ERPNO-580x870.png 580w,    /assets/resized/ERPNO-290x435.png 290w,    /assets/resized/ERPNO-170x255.png 170w,    /assets/resized/ERPNO-145x218.png 145w, /assets/img/posts/21.05.01/ERPNO.png 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 624px) 50vw, 290px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;art&quot;&gt;Art&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ProbablyNot&lt;/strong&gt; is back this month with his infamous 3D scenes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/img/art/ProbablyNot/ProbablyNot_Janitor.png&quot; class=&quot;image-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;    /assets/resized/ProbablyNot_Janitor-580x326.png 580w,    /assets/resized/ProbablyNot_Janitor-290x163.png 290w,    /assets/resized/ProbablyNot_Janitor-170x96.png 170w,    /assets/resized/ProbablyNot_Janitor-145x82.png 145w, /assets/img/art/ProbablyNot/ProbablyNot_Janitor.png 3840w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 578px, 580px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, although we have a download link for each monthy version at the top of each blog post, and keep a link to the latest version on the homepage, we also added a new &lt;a href=&quot;/download/&quot;&gt;Download page&lt;/a&gt; that links to the latest release as well. It’s handier to link to externally and will download the game automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re still over here working so, as always, you know where to find us if you want to follow us closer or come contribute (on &lt;a href=&quot;https://discord.gg/3ny9tdH&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>CosmicCoincidence</name></author><summary type="html">“What could we accomplish if we knew we could not fail?”</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://ss3d.space/assets/img/art/ProbablyNot/ProbablyNot_Janitor.png" /></entry><entry><title type="html">21.04: April 2021 Devblog</title><link href="https://ss3d.space/2021/05/06/21.04.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="21.04: April 2021 Devblog" /><published>2021-05-06T11:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-05-06T11:30:00+00:00</updated><id>https://ss3d.space/2021/05/06/21.04</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ss3d.space/2021/05/06/21.04.html">&lt;p&gt;Surely everything happens for a reason, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;april-recap&quot;&gt;April Recap&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This month’s technical contributions were fairly uneventful, currently we are in the process still of reworking the core system designs, and then implementing some of those systems, most notably the tilemap system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;details&quot;&gt;Details&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Madasski&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;fixed a bug preventing interactions with light fixtures.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;fixed a bug with the examine camera causing inaccurate examinations.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;improved the in-game camera controls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;mjboth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;added a light and emission materials to the inside of the microwave that turns on when it’s active.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/img/posts/21.04.01/MicrowaveLights.png&quot; class=&quot;image-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;    /assets/resized/MicrowaveLights-580x435.png 580w,    /assets/resized/MicrowaveLights-290x218.png 290w,    /assets/resized/MicrowaveLights-170x128.png 170w,    /assets/resized/MicrowaveLights-145x109.png 145w, /assets/img/posts/21.04.01/MicrowaveLights.png 800w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 578px, 580px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;models&quot;&gt;Models&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Baga&lt;/strong&gt; is back this month, contributing a welder, a cookie man, some handcuffs, a set of awesome syringe guns, and finally a collection of PDA cartridges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-2&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basecode&lt;/strong&gt; starting making us a wall-mounted security camera, but someone how managed to combine it with our old IPC, creating a security IPC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-2&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cornelius&lt;/strong&gt; also made a security camera, as well as a human heart, and several new facial hairstyles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-2&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CosmicCoincidence&lt;/strong&gt; improved upon an old ai core model and made several colorful face textures to go with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/img/posts/21.04.01/AICores.png&quot; class=&quot;image-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;    /assets/resized/AICores-580x435.png 580w,    /assets/resized/AICores-290x218.png 290w,    /assets/resized/AICores-170x128.png 170w,    /assets/resized/AICores-145x109.png 145w, /assets/img/posts/21.04.01/AICores.png 800w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 578px, 580px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;textures&quot;&gt;Textures&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With an ai core to now test on, &lt;strong&gt;Konstantin3001&lt;/strong&gt; created &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/img/posts/21.04.01/shodan_simple.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this simple Shodan face texture&lt;/a&gt; to use on the ai core.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/img/posts/21.04.01/AIShodan.png&quot; class=&quot;image-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;    /assets/resized/AIShodan-580x435.png 580w,    /assets/resized/AIShodan-290x218.png 290w,    /assets/resized/AIShodan-170x128.png 170w,    /assets/resized/AIShodan-145x109.png 145w, /assets/img/posts/21.04.01/AIShodan.png 800w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 578px, 580px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when asked if he could produce some toony footprints, he promptly obliged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/img/posts/21.04.01/Footprints.png&quot; class=&quot;image-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;    /assets/resized/Footprints-580x435.png 580w,    /assets/resized/Footprints-290x218.png 290w,    /assets/resized/Footprints-170x128.png 170w,    /assets/resized/Footprints-145x109.png 145w, /assets/img/posts/21.04.01/Footprints.png 800w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 578px, 580px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also scanned &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/img/posts/21.04.01/ss3d_butt_scan.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this picture of his butt for us…&lt;/a&gt; only kidding, &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; seriously this will be the image created when you scan your bare bottom on the photocopier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CosmicCoincidence&lt;/strong&gt; contributed models for a playing card and its box, as well as 2 full sets of card textures (one nantotrasen themed, one syndicate themed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/img/posts/21.04.01/CosmicCards.png&quot; class=&quot;image-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;    /assets/resized/CosmicCards-580x435.png 580w,    /assets/resized/CosmicCards-290x218.png 290w,    /assets/resized/CosmicCards-170x128.png 170w,    /assets/resized/CosmicCards-145x109.png 145w, /assets/img/posts/21.04.01/CosmicCards.png 800w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 578px, 580px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This month’s dev blog art is also brought to you by the &lt;strong&gt;CosmicCoincidence&lt;/strong&gt;, who couldn’t decide how to finish his piece and thus made a couple final variations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;march-recap&quot;&gt;March Recap&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks again to all our lovely supporters, it’s because of you guys we have put forth the effort to make a new plan of action to make a working prototype of a game loop as our new milestone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-milestone&quot;&gt;New Milestone&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We saw that now that money is a factor, we could no longer continue developing randomly. We don’t want to throw bounty money at tasks they may end up completely broken if the underlying systems need future rework. To completely avoid future rework, it would be ideal to develop the game linearly, starting with the most core pieces and working up. This, however, is a very slow process and it’s no secret our development has already been quite slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a team meeting in discord this week (with the added presence from Jack Trachea from UnityStation) discussing these topics. With the added insight from Jack on UnityStation’s development, we concluded it would be highly beneficial to create a ‘game slice’ or a basic playable round to release as a sort of alpha or demo (we decided to focus on the traitor gamemode first). This would hopefully attract some new players, testers, or even developers. And to help achieve this goal in as short of time period as possible, it would be advisable to not include some systems, or in some cases include incomplete systems. But this will likely cause them to need rework later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we broke up the milestone into a 5-step process that we believe balances releasing a playable game loop ASAP and reducing future rework. Each part of this process also has its own &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/RE-SS3D/SS3D/milestones&quot;&gt;milestone page on our github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First and foremost, we need to design our major systems to all be future-proof even if we aren’t implementing them fully yet. The core systems we do need to be fully robust initially are at least interactions, containers, &amp;amp; tilemap. Currently, the tilemap system needs an overhaul due to trouble scaling. Interactions may need some upgrades too.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Secondly, we need a few new systems like animation, clothing, &amp;amp; basic health. Health is one of those that we will have a complex design for but our first implementation will be basic. We need some form of health in our demo for playability, but we will plan for its future replacement.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Third we need some complementary systems like basic construction, crafting, &amp;amp; combat.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fourth, we need to dump in some content for jobs so the player has things to do.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finally, a server hub and a traitor gamemode makes it a fairly complete loop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here we have begun creating tasks for this process and will be adding bounties values to many of them soon. So although we do not have any bounties made just yet, if you have been wondering where your donation money will be going, it will first be distributed to tasks in step-1 of our milestone process once we conclude their bounty worth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;details&quot;&gt;Details&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goao (John)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Added some basic graphic quality settings to the lobby menu, this may help those with slower PCs test our current game.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Went through and commented on lots of our undocumented code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;models&quot;&gt;Models&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cornelius&lt;/strong&gt; still on a roll, contributing some apples, bbq sauce, and a very badass and very large &lt;del&gt;xeno&lt;/del&gt; alien queen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Onebi&lt;/strong&gt; is back after several moons and brings us these modular cyberdecks. Not sure what a cyberdeck is? Think of it as a sci-fi hacking tool that connects with the user’s brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be having another dev meeting in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://discord.gg/3ny9tdH&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt; if you want to follow along close with our next moves. It will be on April 3rd (today) at 8pm UST.

&lt;p&gt;Keep your arms and legs inside the space station at all times during your stay!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;optional-connections&quot;&gt;Optional Connections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BroodjeKipcorn&lt;/strong&gt; added the much-needed feature of optional connections for things like pipes &amp;amp; wires. So now the user can decide when and in what direction these fixtures attach. Currently, this is only possible in the map editor but will be expanded to in-game once the functionality to interact with the fixtures is implemented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;container-ui&quot;&gt;Container UI&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goao&lt;/strong&gt; was sick of looking at our &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/img/posts/21.02.01/ContainerUI_Old.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;old container UI&lt;/a&gt;, so he quickly whipped together a new one for us which includes a scroll wheel if the container is large and has many slots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;details&quot;&gt;Details&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;peeB&lt;/strong&gt;, whose been an active member in our community since day 1 but a new contributor this month…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improved interaction for the pepper spray item.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improved interaction for the lighter item, including animations.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improved interaction for the wet floor sign, including open/close animations.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improved interaction for the airlocks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enhanced the interaction distance check for a more realistic interaction range.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goao&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed a couple of bugs related to the round timer and joining a round.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BroodjeKipcorn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Added sound fall-off for the airlock’s interaction.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Added basic interactions for lights (turning them on &amp;amp; off), but this seems to have already broken with another change to interactions themselves. Hopefully, it will be fixed again soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;models&quot;&gt;Models&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another new contributor this month, &lt;strong&gt;Putski&lt;/strong&gt; made this great ore crate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, thank you to everyone who has donated to the project over the last month! We have raised a little over $325 our first month, and every dollar is much appreciated! Look forward to hearing from us this next month on how these funds will be allocated for bounties (the health system will likely be one).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So stay tuned, and check out our &lt;a href=&quot;https://discord.gg/3ny9tdH&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt; for more info.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>CosmicCoincidence</name></author><summary type="html">What is this, a zoo in space?</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://ss3d.space/assets/img/art/Bug/Bug_CargoAnimals.png" /></entry><entry><title type="html">21.01: January 2021 Devblog</title><link href="https://ss3d.space/2021/02/04/21.01.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="21.01: January 2021 Devblog" /><published>2021-02-04T11:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-02-04T11:30:00+00:00</updated><id>https://ss3d.space/2021/02/04/21.01</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ss3d.space/2021/02/04/21.01.html">&lt;p&gt;Spatial awareness is a necessary skill to do your job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;january-recap&quot;&gt;January Recap&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a new year, and we have a new wave of contributions. Strap in yall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lobby--main-menu&quot;&gt;Lobby &amp;amp; Main Menu&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our biggest and probably most important feature this month has got to be our fancy new lobby system. &lt;strong&gt;John&lt;/strong&gt; was hard at work this month separating the map, primary menus, and lobby from a unified scene to individual scenes. The result is more modular in the sense that the editor can more easily work on these systems without impacting the others as much. It also allows us to quickly swap between map scenes now both in the Unity editor but now in-game, getting us 1 more step closer to a complete game loop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connecting players will now be initially greeted with a basic lobby to hang out in (character customization and chat will eventually be added in here) until they’re ready to join. The game host also now has access to an admin menu to control various parameters for the game. This ranges from changing the map, game mode (just for show currently), and setting a timer for the length of time until the next round starts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;video controls=&quot;&quot; muted=&quot;&quot; poster=&quot;/assets/img/posts/21.01.01/LobbyMenu.png&quot; width=&quot;580px&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;
  &lt;source src=&quot;/assets/img/posts/21.01.01/LobbyMenu.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tilemap-editor&quot;&gt;TileMap Editor&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally started by &lt;strong&gt;DefNotEric&lt;/strong&gt; many moons ago, but recently resurrected and expanded by &lt;strong&gt;BroodjeKipcorn&lt;/strong&gt;, our new tilemap editor is a significant improvement over our previous one. Now the editor can edit/add tilemap layers individually rather than having to rebuild all layers on a tile if a single layer on that tile needs a change. You can even hide the visibility of layers in the editor to make it easier to see what you are working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The map editor also now has an object search functionality and the objects have a small thumbnail display so the user can find what they are looking for more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other big improvement is the addition of tilemap rotations. As we did not have proper tilemap rotations built into the editor before, the user would have to manually edit the Y-axis rotation on each prefab after adding it to the map. Now the user can simply select a cardinal direction for the object to face before adding it to the map. Many small bugs related to the tilemap were also taken care of with this new tilemap editor.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;source src=&quot;/assets/img/posts/21.01.01/TilemapEditor.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;container-system&quot;&gt;Container System&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alainx&lt;/strong&gt; did a great job over the last couple of months, overhauling our existing system for containers. This new system uses a Resident Evil-like 2-dimensional modular approach, allowing things like containers on child objects, multiple containers per object, and more. The system also adds functionality for things like wearables (clothing) for mobs. The system is server authoritative, which should be robust when protecting against cheating. This new system flushed out some lingering inventory-related bugs as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/img/posts/21.01.01/ModularContainers.png&quot; class=&quot;image-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;    /assets/resized/ModularContainers-580x326.png 580w,    /assets/resized/ModularContainers-290x163.png 290w,    /assets/resized/ModularContainers-170x96.png 170w,    /assets/resized/ModularContainers-145x82.png 145w, /assets/img/posts/21.01.01/ModularContainers.png 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 578px, 580px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;details&quot;&gt;Details&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BroodjeKipcorn&lt;/strong&gt; improved the atmospheric loop performance, drastically reducing the CPU time and memory allocations needed to run it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John&lt;/strong&gt; cleaned up many more models this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;textures&quot;&gt;Textures&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Konstatin&lt;/strong&gt; made a nice new texture for the station AI. You probably recognize her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/img/posts/21.01.01/shodan_white.png&quot; class=&quot;image-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;    /assets/resized/shodan_white-580x579.png 580w,    /assets/resized/shodan_white-290x290.png 290w,    /assets/resized/shodan_white-170x170.png 170w,    /assets/resized/shodan_white-145x145.png 145w, /assets/img/posts/21.01.01/shodan_white.png 4896w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 578px, 580px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;art&quot;&gt;Art&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ProbablyNot&lt;/strong&gt; is back to being this month’s cover artist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/img/art/ProbablyNot/ProbablyNot_PDA.png&quot; class=&quot;image-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;    /assets/resized/ProbablyNot_PDA-580x326.png 580w,    /assets/resized/ProbablyNot_PDA-290x163.png 290w,    /assets/resized/ProbablyNot_PDA-170x96.png 170w,    /assets/resized/ProbablyNot_PDA-145x82.png 145w, /assets/img/art/ProbablyNot/ProbablyNot_PDA.png 3842w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 578px, 580px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;updates&quot;&gt;Updates&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To kick off this new year, we are finally launching a means to support the development of this game via donations. We have launched a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/ss3d&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Patreon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.subscribestar.com/space-station-3d&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SubscribeStar&lt;/a&gt;, and even a multi-chain crypto wallet + .crypto domain (SpaceStation3D.crypto) which accepts multiple cryptocurrencies, but not all wallets accept this format so you can find the full blockchain addresses at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/RE-SS3D/SS3D/wiki/Related-Sites-&amp;amp;-Resources#donation-links&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the bottom of this page&lt;/a&gt; or at the top of our &lt;a href=&quot;/contribute/&quot;&gt;Contribute page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The money gathered from our donations will primarily be used for paying technical bounties which we will launch once we have received adequate initial funds. Eventually, the donations will also be used to help cover any costs to continue developing &amp;amp; hosting this game (like paying to host servers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; important thing we want to ensure is that we are COMPLETELY transparent about how we use your donations for this project. So we have set up a #money-log channel on our discord which will log our donations and how they are spent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been a rough past year. But 2021 is already showing some promise, especially for SS3D. Stay safe and stay tuned everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
