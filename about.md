# What is RE:SS3D?

RE:SS3D is a resurrection of *beep's SS3D. If you go digging for SS3D, you'll find bits and pieces, but you will ultimately find a trail that ends in silence.

## What is SS3D and who is *beep?

One day in early 2018, an individual by the name of *beep decided to create a game called SS3D (a 3D recreation of Space Station 13 using the Unity game engine), based on his well-received demo. *beep was brilliant, and for those few wonderful months of early 2018, *beep made leaps of progress faster than any remake before. The dream of SS3D was becoming certain and inevitable.

But when the world needed him most, he vanished... No trace, no word, no *beep. The only thing left behind were a couple of files, a .blend, and a .pdf... Though *beep had intended to release the game open source, all of the development up to that point was still private and had vanished along with him.

Many were appalled by this tragedy, some were content to continue waiting for *beep's return, a few handfuls chased after the ghost of *beep, searching every trail for any clue of what happened or where *beep went, but always found nothing.

Eventually, several months later, a message came from the hands of one who was once beneath *beep: "it's dead," and "I'm sorry." Suddenly and with little to no notice, almost every memory of communications regarding the project was neatly tidied up and packaged for prosperity, and all the rest was deleted or left to deliberate anarchy.

In the ashes immediately following the abandonment of the project to the horribly transient nature of anarchy, a suggestion was formed that some should take up the mantle and continue the project. A modest amount of support was garnered, and very quickly a **very** crude team was thrown together. The new project was named "RE:SS3D".

## Where is RE:SS3D now?

RE:SS3D is fully open-source and is located on [github](https://github.com/RE-SS3D). We have quite a few dedicated contributors of different types, although, admittedly our art departments move a bit faster than the technical ones. See our progress on our [devblog page]({{ site.baseurl }}/devblog/).

## I want to help!

You can help out in multiple ways, just check out our [contribute page]({{ site.baseurl }}/contribute/) and come say hello in our [discord](https://discord.gg/3ny9tdH)!

### Thanks!

Oftentimes life imposes itself on our voluntary contributors, sadly resulting in not just multiple arrivals, but also departures. Some people even relate this back to *beep and wonder if he simply got caught up with other aspects of his life and simply didn't have time to continue. Thankfully, the open-source nature of the new project allows others to pick up where previous individuals left off, which limits the negative impact of departures.

**We deeply thank those who have contributed in the past in any form and hope that they will come back in the future even to just play the game that they helped create.**
